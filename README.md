# geovac-ai-bot

This is another simple implementation showing the power of the RAG architecture for individualized learning. This uses the Gemini ai api and the wonderful Streamlit for UI presentation. The service can be scaled to any industry or use case - I am currently expanding this to Fraud/AML e2e chain. My intention is to build an ETL pipeline that feeds KYC data, social media activity feed - basically online presence - to a cloud DB and have RAG sit on and vectorize the data (multimodal) for proactive profiling and risk assessment. This will be enriched with transaction data depending on the use case.

You will need to obtain a gemini api key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey then add it to the env file.

Enjoy!
