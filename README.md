This is another simple implementation showing the power of the RAG architecture for individualized learning. This can be scaled to any industry or use case - I am currently expanding this to Fraud/AML e2e chain. My intention is to build an ETL pipeline that feeds KYC data, social media activity feed - basically online presence - to a cloud DB and have RAG sit on and vectorize the data (multimodal) for proactive profiling and risk assessment. This will be enriched with transaction data depending on the use case.

Enjoy!
